# React Boilerplate

## Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Jest
- Webpack
- Prettier
- ESLint
- HMR - react-refresh

### babel vs ts-loader

babel was chosen due to the ease of integrating all compile steps with babel. I had difficulty integrating react-refresh with ts-loader which resulted in me choosing babel over ts-loader.

### HMR - react-refresh

Note: Tried with ts-loader, but was unsuccessful and receiving an error something along the lines of `HMR Error: aborted because index.tsx is not accepted...update propagation`

### ESLint

- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- React / Hooks
- JSX a11y
- Jest / jest-dom
- testing-library

### Testing

- Jest
- @testing-library

### Styling

No particular preference on styling. Styling may come directly on on separate branches per pre-processor.

### TODO

- [] Basic production build setup
- [] Basic Docker setup
- [] commit hooks with husky
